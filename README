This code is used to fetch papers from online in a DWIMy way.

Currently only works in a hack-ish state.

The proxy code assumes you are using UH's proxy, but should be easy to adapt.
It uses the environment variables:

UH_COUGARNET_USER="user"
UH_COUGARNET_PASS="pass"

Currently supports:

* searching: Google Scholar
* downloading metadata and PDFs from: ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, IEEE

TODO:

* write documentation
* support more sources
* automatically dispatch to source plugins
* fetch/generate clean BibTeX 

WARNING: This code is only meant to be used for personal use. Do not use this
for systematic downloading of papers as this will likely violate agreements
between your institution and publishers.

Requires from CPAN:

* LWP (libwww-perl)
* LWP::Protocol::https (liblwp-protocol-https-perl)
* Moo (libmoo-perl)
* HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath (libhtml-treebuilder-xpath-perl)
* HTML::Form (libhtml-form-perl)
* Regexp::Common (libregexp-common-perl)
* Test::Deep (libtest-deep-perl)
* Text::BibTeX (libtext-bibtex-perl)
* Try::Tiny (libtry-tiny-perl)
* URI (liburi-perl)
* utf8::all (libutf8-all-perl);
* MooX::Types::MooseLike
* File::Slurp (libfile-slurp-perl)

Also, one of the tests requires the `see` command (mime-support).
